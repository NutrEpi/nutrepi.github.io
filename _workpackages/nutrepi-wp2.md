Variation of 1-C donor in the yolk of Atlantic salmon influences gene expression and DNA methylation patterns during early development stages.

## Objective
A study at our lab has shown that deposits of 1-C nutritions in the yolk of Atlantic salmon vary among egg batches and spawning seasons (Hamre, unpublished), which is potentially related to differences in broodstock feeding and the storage of nutrients during oogonia maturation. In NutrEpi WP2, we aim to elucidate the effect of different spawning seasons
on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns.

## Experimental design
Samples were collected at four different spawning seasons to determine the effects of 1-C nutrients in embryos.

- Off season
- Early season
- Regular season (October-November)
- Late season
