Optimized levels of 1-C nutrients increase the robustness during smoltification through epigenetic gene regulation.

## Objective

Studies from both salmon and zebrafish have shown that the 1-C inclusion in the feed determines the growth as well as the overall 1-C nutrients and amino acid compositions in the body. In NutrEpi WP3, we utilise 1-C supplements trough smoltification to analyse the effect of 1-C inclusions on gene expression and DNA methylation patterns.

## Experimental design
Triplicate groups were fed with graded levels of 1-C nutrients trough smoltification.

- Low (recommended composition of 1-C nutrients for Atlantic salmon)
- Medium
- High
