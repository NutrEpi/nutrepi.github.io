Nutritional 1-C levels through a whole-life feeding trial influence gene expression and DNA methylation patterns in liver and gonad.

## Objective

The main goal of NutrEpi WP 1 is to elucidate the effect of micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) on metabolic pathways from a genetic and epigenetic point of view. From previous results from zebrafish studies ([Skjærven et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34535), [Skjærven et al., 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21211-5)), it is known that a parental vitamin deficiency affects the embryonic gene expression of immune and lipid related genes.

## Experimental design
A whole life cycle feeding trial (over 54 weeks) of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was conducted under the EU funded [ARRAINA](https://www.arraina.eu/) (advanced research initiatives for nutrition and aquaculture) project ([Vera et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735551)).

Through the trial, triplicate groups - L1, L2, L3 - were fed with graded levels of micronutrient supplements, formulated with nutrition package (NP).
- L1: 100% NP (recommended composition of NP for Atlantic salmon)
- L2: 200% NP
- L3: 400% NP
